Text to world using OpenAI and procedural generation techniques.

## Introduction

This Unity Project focuses on creating procedurally generated worlds from a simple text-prompt.

Using OpenAI's ChatGPT a text can be transformed into commands that will be used to procedurally generate a world compatible with Unity's Terrain Tools assets.

The idea is to simplify creating worlds for your purposes. This can speed up the process of brainstorming and game-/ software-development.

## Notes

Project is still in development and currently only includes procedural terrain-generation.

Currently only HDRP is supported.
